# React E-Commerce Application

This repository is dedicated to studying and building a React-based e-commerce application as part of the Entri class on React development. The project focuses on applying core React concepts to create a functional and dynamic e-commerce platform.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to gain a practical understanding of React while developing an e-commerce platform. It includes features such as product listings, a shopping cart, and dynamic interactions using React’s component-based architecture.

## Features

- **Product Listings**: Display a variety of products with images, descriptions, and prices.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts for different screen sizes, making it user-friendly across devices.
- **State Management**: Effective use of React state and props to manage dynamic data.
  
## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Core programming language.
- **CSS/SCSS**: Styling the application.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **React Router**: For handling routing in the application.

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/entri-react-ecommerce.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd entri-react-ecommerce
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. Open the application in your browser:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

## Learning Objectives

- **React Components**: Understanding functional components and reusable UI elements.
- **State & Props**: Managing and passing data between components.
- **Event Handling**: Handling user interactions in the application.
- **Hooks**: Utilizing React hooks like `useState` and `useEffect` for state management and side effects.
- **Routing**: Implementing multi-page navigation with React Router.
